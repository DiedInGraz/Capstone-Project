#sequence to import data into a database:

#Start the project using docker-compose. You must be in the following directory to run this command: section01-group02/dockerConfig/
docker-compose up

#In a new terminal (terminal #2), access the Mongo container
docker exec -it dockerconfig_mongo-db_1 bash

#Inside of the Mongo container, import admin user (for a blank install)
mongorestore --db serverTest blankInstall/serverTest

#In a new terminal (terminal #3), access the Strapi container (Do not close the terminal that has the Mongo container running)
docker exec -it dockerconfig_strapi-frontend_1 bash

#Inside of the Strapi container, change directory to project directory
cd section01-group02/strapi/

#Inside of the Strapi container, install Strapi with special privileges, then have Strapi launch. This may take a while (~3 min) - make some coffee. 
npm install --unsafe-perm && strapi start

#Inside of the Strapi container, quit the Strapi process
CTRL-C

#Inside of the Strapi container, exit the Strapi container
exit

#Save the changes to the Mongo container so that the next time you start the project using docker-compose, the Mongo container with the updated database will be the one used.
docker commit dockerconfig_mongo-db_1 mongo-db:0.0

#Exit the current terminal (terminal #3)
exit

#Inside of the Mongo container, exit the Mongo container
exit

#Exit the current terminal (terminal #2)
exit

#You should now be back at the terminal where you ran docker-compose. Quit the current docker-compose command by using CTRL-C twice.
CTRL-C
CTRL-C

#Start the project using docker-compose. Your databse should now have all the data you need, and the project will be running in localhost:3000 and localhost:1337
docker-compose up

#Login to Strapi and change the admin email (using the GUI at localhost:1337)
username: admin
