## Setup

Start the docker containers (you must be in this directory)
 - `docker-compose up`

Once the command has run, populate and properly start the strapi container
- `./startStrapiWithDemoData`

If a container stops, you can try to run it again using either of the two commands (try start first)
 - `docker start container_name`
 - `docker run container_name`
